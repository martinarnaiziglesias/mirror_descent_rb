# Project Overview

The project consists of five notebooks:

- **Notebooks 1-4**: These are used to generate and store results in the `Output` folder.
- **Notebook 5**: This is used to visualize the stored data and create figures as presented in the paper.

## Notes

- The necessary output files have already been saved in the `Output` folder and are ready for visualization.
- Running any of the first four notebooks will overwrite the existing files in the `Output` folder and will require additional computation time.
