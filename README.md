# Project Overview
The present code allows to obtain similar results to the ones of the paper "Mirror Descent Algorithms for Risk Budgeting Portfolios" by Mart√≠n Arnaiz Iglesias, Adil Rengim Cetingoz and Noufel Frikha

The project consists of eight notebooks:

- **Notebooks 0_1 - 0_2**: Provides similar results to section 4.1 of the paper
- **Notebooks 1-6**: Provides similar results to sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the paper, with:
    - **Notebooks 1-4**: These are used to generate and store results in the `Output` folder.
    - **Notebook 5**: This is used to visualize the stored data and create figures as presented in the paper.
    - **Notebook 6**: Similar results to table 7 of the paper.


## Notes

- The necessary output files have already been saved in the `Output` folder and are ready for visualization.
- Running any of the first four notebooks will overwrite the existing files in the `Output` folder and will require additional computation time.
